Hey Today is my worst day I have in this year. there are many reasons for this like first of all my getting regrate for i'm leaving my development and ignore my actual strength that is consistency that I do coding but recent days I never touch code and my laptop i'm get comfortable in my life an ignore all things that will be effecting in my current life and now i am not that much happy with my own growth that i did in last some days.
2nd is i am not able to maintain my personality improvement plan for recent just giving excuse of that but not work on that part.
i have to realise that i not be done now need to do more and more in our life to get settled it is just milestone that i achieved in recent days. job is not a ultimate solution for this and this job is not a best option for you .
i think i deserve more better company where people are so much dedicated to work it never depends on that higher peoples. you are always wrong if they feel it's wrong.

so there are some changes need to done in yourself then you will be grow in your carrier without that not possible to anything in your life okay 

There are some habit need to be change in your day to day life.
1.Stay consistent in your life.
